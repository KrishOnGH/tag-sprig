## Game Overview

Tag is a thrilling chase game where two players compete against each other and the clock. One player starts as "it" and must tag the other player before time runs out. The game is set in a platformer-style environment, adding an extra layer of strategy and fun to the classic tag concept.

## How to Play

1. **Player One (Tagged Initially)**:
   - Jump: W
   - Move Left: A
   - Move Right: D

2. **Player Two**:
   - Jump: I
   - Move Left: J
   - Move Right: L

3. **Restart Game**: Press K at any time to restart

## Game Rules

- Player One starts as "tagged" (it).
- The tagged player must catch and tag the other player by running into them.
- A timer in the top right corner counts down.
- When the timer reaches zero, the player who is not tagged wins!

## Strategy Tips

- Use the platforms to your advantage - jump to higher ground to escape or chase!
- Keep an eye on the timer and plan your moves accordingly.
- Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense. Try to predict your opponent's movements!
